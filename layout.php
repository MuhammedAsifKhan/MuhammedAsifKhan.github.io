	<h1>Chicken Roast Made From Organic Herbs & Spices</h1>
	<p>What do you get if you mix Bangladeshi flavours with an Alpha classic cooked roast? This amazing recipe is what!
Juicy gravy chicken marinated with cumin, turmeric and garam masala and given a good dose of garlic, chilli and ginger for added kick. Dunked in to a rich gravy sauce and served with homemade chutney. Goes oh so well with polao, kacchi or the old favourite - paratha. Life doesn't get much better than this.</p>

	<h1>Meet Our Head Chef - Nicolas Rozario!</h1>
	<p> His name is Nicolas D. Costa. After working for a decade in the Middle East, he came back to Bangladesh and joined as head chef for the ambassador's residence of the German Embassy. Chef Nicolas loved his work there. As foreign guests often visited the ambassador, he got to make all sorts of continental delicacies. Apple pie, fruit custard trifle, chocolate mousse, lasagna, T-bone steak, quiche etc. and so on. We never heard some of them!</p>
